                                        If you use our search services, we use commercially reasonable methods to
                                        identify
                                        marks that may be matches to the ones you seek to use. We, however, cannot
                                        guarantee
                                        that your mark will make it through and be approved even if you use our search
                                        services. There may be a number of reasons the USPTO rejects your mark and there
                                        are
                                        circumstances where an automated search may not identify a mark the USPTO
                                        identifies
                                        as a reason to reject your mark.

                                        Likewise, when your order covers common law mark searches, we use commercially
                                        reasonable methods to identify marks that may be matches to the ones you seek to
                                        use. We, however, cannot guarantee that your mark will be free of or prevail to
                                        all
                                        claims or challenges made by holders of common law rights to all marks. There

                                        circumstances where an automated search may not identify a common law mark that
                                        may
                                        be similar to your mark.

                                        considered similar to another mark. You may want to consult with an attorney
                                        regarding the results of the search report we furnish you.

                                        Logo design services are offered on the Website. Once you make the required
                                        payment
                                        and provide us with the specifications for your logo, our designers create a
                                        unique,
                                        original logo in accordance with your instructions and the package you
                                        purchased.
                                        After completing the initial design(s) of your logo, we will provide you with
                                        potential logos (the “Initial Design Samples”). At this point you may accept an
                                        Initial Design Sample, request revisions, or request a refund. There is no
                                        additional fee for revisions, provided the requested revisions does not conflict
                                        with your original logo specifications. The number of revisions you may request
                                        is
                                        dependent upon the design package you purchased. Turnaround time for a revision
                                        is
                                        1-2 business days. After accepting a design as your final logo, whether
                                        acceptance
                                        was made after receiving the Initial Design Sample or after requesting
                                        revisions, we
                                        will send you the completed logo (the “Final Distribution”).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After the Final Distribution, you gain the ownership of the final logo. We only
                                        retain the right to use the final logo, or any logo created in the process,
                                        within
                                        printed and on-line portfolios, including promotional materials such as
                                        newsletters
                                        and advertisements. You understand that after receiving the logo via the Final
                                        Distribution, you will still need to register the logo with the appropriate
                                        governmental agency to gain full intellectual property rights to your logo. An
                                        incomplete transaction results in retaining all
                                        intellectual
                                        property rights of the designed logo.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        If a refund request for the logo services is submitted before receiving your
                                        Initial
                                        Design Samples, you may be eligible for a 100% refund. If a refund request is
                                        submitted within 72 hours of receipt of the Initial Design Samples, and before
                                        you
                                        request any changes, you may be eligible for a refund. You are ineligible for a
                                        refund after you request revisions to an Initial Design Sample. You are
                                        ineligible
                                        for a refund if the request is submitted after 72 hours of the receipt of the
                                        Initial Design Samples. You are ineligible for a refund if your order is
                                        terminated
                                        due to a breach of these Terms of Service or any of the policies herein
                                        referenced.

                                        Regardless of the language used elsewhere in this Section, we reserve the right

                                        used
                                        elsewhere in this Section, we also reserve the right to approve or deny a refund
                                        request on a case-by-case basis. If the design you receive is defective or not
                                        the
                                        same as shown at the time of purchasing, and the defect is not a delivery error,
                                        then you will be entitled to a refund. Whether a logo is defective is at our

                            Later in this process, Secure Your Mark collects and pays the
                            government-discounted TEAS Standard electronic filing fee of $350.
                            In some circumstances, your application may qualify for the
                            less-available TEAS PLUS system which means we will pay $250 to
                            the USPTO which streamlines the process. If your application
                            qualifies for TEAS PLUS, we will use it and retain the difference
                            between the TEAS Standard filing fee and the TEAS Plus filing fee
                            as a result of the additional processing by the Secure Your Mark.
