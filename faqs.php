                                A trademark is a distinguishing image, sound, word, pattern, or combination of these
                                that stands for and distinguishes a particular supplier of products or services. It acts
                                as a distinguishing mark of origin, separating the goods or services of one company from
                                those of others, and it offers legal defense against unlawful usage by rivals.

                        <div class="answer">
                            <p>
                                The process for submitting a trademark application is governed by law and typically
                                entails conducting a thorough trademark search and creating a trademark application with
                                accurate information.

                        <div class="answer">
                            <p>
                                To obtain a trademark for a logo, file a trademark application with the appropriate
                                intellectual property office in your country. Please include a clear logo
                                representation, specify the associated goods or services, and the Trademark logo cost.
                                Consult with trademark attorneys for assistance throughout the process.

                                The owner can file a petition to remove a trademark from the register for cancellation
                                or non-renewal of expired US Trademark Registry with the appropriate intellectual
                                property office. This typically involves demonstrating valid grounds for cancellation,
                                such as non-use, abandonment, or generalness. The process may involve legal proceedings
                                and a decision by the trademark authorities.

                                A trademark logo creates a significant impact by serving as the visual representation of
                                a brand. It helps establish brand recognition, instill consumer trust and loyalty,
                                differentiate products or services from competitors, and contribute to a business's
                                overall reputation and market positioning.

                        <div class="answer">

                                A company name and a logo can be registered as trademarks. A company name can be
                                registered as a trademark to protect its exclusive use with specific goods or services.
                                Likewise, a logo can be registered as a trademark to secure exclusive rights to its
                                design and prevent others from using a similar mark.
